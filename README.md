# UT-Math-Journal
Instructions and files for contributors to the UT Math Journal. More details can be 
found in README.pdf. With regards to preamble content, if you want to add custom 
macros in the style file, you can do it yourself and then file a pull request if 
you are familiar with git, or you can contact the math club through more traditional
means. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out to 
utmathjournal@gmail.com.
